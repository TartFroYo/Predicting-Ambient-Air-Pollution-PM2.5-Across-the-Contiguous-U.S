# Predicting Ambient Air Pollution PM2.5 Across the Contiguous U.S 
**by Aileen Li & Nyah Strickland**

Our objective was to choose 4 ML models to predict ambient air pollution across the US, find which one has the highest accuracy based on RMSE, and interpret it.

Here is our [report](https://github.com/TartFroYo/Predicting-Ambient-Air-Pollution-PM2.5-Across-the-Contiguous-U.S/blob/main/Predicting_Ambient_Air_Pollution__PM2.5__Across_the_Contiguous_U.S_.pdf) for more details.
