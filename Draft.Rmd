## Predicting Ambient Air Pollution (PM2.5) Across the Contiguous U.S.

  Air pollution has consequences for everyone, most especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Air pollution is measured in tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one-half microns or less in width called PM2.5. So being able to predict the average PM2.5 concentrations will allow us to keep people most vulnerable safe as we look for and implement changes to improve the air quality in the region.
We chose the predictors by …
For our four models, we chose linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, bootstrapping, and random forest. Linear regression models a linear relationship between the PM2.5 value in the atmosphere and the predictors. K-nearest neighbors (kNN) returns predicted PM2.5 values based on their neighboring data points. Bootstrapping resamples the given data multiple times and returns predictions based on their average. Random forest makes an averaged prediction from a collection of independent decision trees. We predict that the RMSE performance of the bootstrapping model will be the best, with a value of around 0.5.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(broom)
library(caret)
library(plotROC)

origin <- read_csv("https://github.com/rdpeng/stat322E_public/raw/main/data/pm25_data.csv.gz")
```

## Wrangling
```{r Predictors}
# Split origin dataset into 80/20
dat_split <- initial_split(origin, prop =.8)
dat_split

# Use 80% of data for training 
train <- training(dat_split)

# Create standardize train data for kNN


# Visualize linear relationship between predictors (lat, lon, state) and value
origin |> ggplot(aes(x=lon, y=value)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title="PM2.5 Concentration (mu g/m^3)", x="Longitude (degrees)", y="PM2.5")

```

## Models 
```{r Linear Regression}
# Create the recipe for all models
rec <- train %>% 
    recipe(value ~ lat + lon + state) 

# Linear regr. model
model1 <- linear_reg() %>% 
    set_engine("lm") %>% 
    set_mode("regression")

wf1 <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(rec) %>% 
    add_model(model1)
# wf1

res1 <- fit(wf1, data = train)

# Check performance of linear regression model on the training data
res1 %>% 
    extract_fit_engine() %>% 
    summary()

# Check linear regression model performance using cross-validation
folds1 <- vfold_cv(train, v = 10)
folds1
res1 <- fit_resamples(wf1, resamples = folds1)
res1 %>% 
    collect_metrics()
```

```{r kNN}
# Find ideal k neighbors
sqrt(nrow(train))

# Scale the training data for k-NN model
train_scaled = train |> dplyr::select(where(is.numeric)) |> mutate(across(fips:aod, scale)) |> cbind(state=train$state,county=train$county,city=train$city)

# Create kNN model
model2 <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 26) %>% 
    set_engine("kknn") %>% 
    set_mode("regression")

# Create workflow
  wf2 <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(rec) %>% 
    add_model(model2)

# Fit the model on the full training dataset using the `fit()` function
res2 <- fit(wf2, data = train_scaled)

# Check performance on the complete training data
res2 %>% 
    extract_fit_engine() %>% 
    summary()

# Check performance using cross-validation
folds2 <- vfold_cv(train, v = 10)
# folds
res2 <- fit_resamples(wf2, resamples = folds2) # ERROR Assigned data `orig_rows` must be compatible with existing data.
res2 %>% 
    collect_metrics()
```

```{r Bootstrap}
# Create Bootstrap Model (resampling data)
set.seed(123)
model3 <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 5) %>% 
    set_engine("kknn") %>% 
    set_mode("classification")

# Create workflow
  wf3 <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(rec) %>% 
    add_model(model3)
    
```

```{r Random Forests}
# Create Random Forest Model
model4 <- rand_forest(mtry = 5) %>% 
    set_engine("ranger") %>% 
    set_mode("regression")

# Create workflow
  wf4 <- workflow() %>% 
    add_recipe(rec) %>% 
    add_model(model4)

```

## Results
Describe the development of your 3 prediction models (or 4 models, if working in a group) and
how you compared their performance. 
Be sure to describe the splitting of training and testing datasets 
and the use of cross-validation to evaluate prediction metrics. 
Remember that the primary metric for your prediction model will be root-mean-squared error (RMSE). 
Your results should include 
at least one visualization demonstrating the prediction performance of your models. 
You should also include 
a table summarizing the prediction metrics (including RMSE) across all of the models that you tried.

1. Based on test set performance, at what locations does your model give predictions that
are closest and furthest from the observed values? What do you hypothesize are the
reasons for the good or bad performance at these locations?
2. What variables might predict where your model performs well or not? For example, are
their regions of the country where the model does better or worse? Are there variables
that are not included in this dataset that you think might improve the model performance
if they were included in your model?
3. There is interest in developing more cost-effect approaches to monitoring air pollution
on the ground. Two candidates for replacing the use of ground-based monitors are
numerical models like CMAQ and satellite-based observations such as AOD. How well do
CMAQ and AOD predict ground-level concentrations of PM2.5? How does the prediction
performance of your model change when CMAQ or aod are included (or not included) in
the model?
4. The dataset here did not include data from Alaska or Hawaii. Do you think your model
will perform well or not in those two states? Explain your reasoning


## Discussion
Putting it all together, what did you learn from your data and your model performance?
• Answer your Question posed above, citing any supporting statistics, visualizations, or results from the data or your models.
• Reflect on the process of conducting this project. What was challenging, what have you learned from the process itself?
• Reflect on the performance of your final prediction model. Did it perform as well as you originally expected? If not, why do you think it didn’t perform as well?
• Include acknowledgments for any help received. If a group project, report the contribution of each member (i.e. who did what?).
